# wk4_project_mikes_gym

Rules
The project must be built using only:

HTML / CSS
Ruby
Sinatra
PostgreSQL and the PG gem
It must NOT use:

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.
All of these will be covered later in the course. Do not make any attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits. The number of commits in your final submission is one of the criteria your work will be judged on.

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

MVP
The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class
